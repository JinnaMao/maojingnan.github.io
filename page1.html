					<center style="font-weight: bold;">Weggli Bread Rolls</center>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Serving Size:</p>
					<p>8 buns</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Time:</p>
					<p>2.5 hours</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Difficulty:</p>
					<p>Easy</p>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Ingredients</p>
					<ul>
						<li>3 ½ - 4 cups (500 g) bread flour</li>
						<li>1 ½ teaspoons (9 g) salt</li>
						<li>1/3 cup (75 g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
						<li>2 ¼ teaspoons (7 g) active dry yeast</li>
						<li>1 ¼ cups (300 ml) milk, lukewarm</li>
						<li>1 egg (beaten)</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="font-weight: bold;">Directions</p>
					<ul>
						<li>1.Whisk the bread flour and salt together in a large bowl. Add the softened butter in pieces. Make a well in the center. Set aside.</li>
						<li>2.Add the yeast to the lukewarm milk. Set aside a few minutes and then stir until the yeast has dissolved.</li>
						<li>3.Pour the yeast mixture into the middle of the flour mixture. Stir until a soft dough forms. Add additional flour, as necessary, if the dough is too sticky.</li>
						<li>4.Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes on a lightly floured surface or use an electric mixer with a dough hook. When the dough is smooth and elastic, place it in a bowl covered with a damp kitchen towel. Let the dough rise for about 1 to 2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
						<li>5.After the dough has finished rising, divide it into eight equal parts. Moving your hand in a circular motion over and around the individual pieces of dough, form them into rounded shapes. Then, press the dough with your hands and flatten them slightly to about 2 cm (3/4 of an inch) thick.</li>
						<li>6.Place the buns evenly spaced on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Next, using a dowel, such as the handle of a wooden spoon, make a very deep indentation in the middle of the dough circle. Let them rise for another 30 minutes.</li>
						<li>7.Heat the oven to 400°F/200°C. When it’s ready, press down again in the middle of the buns, in the same place as you did before, to ensure the indentation is well-defined. Then, brush the buns with the beaten egg. Place them in the oven to bake for about 18 to 25 minutes or until their surface becomes golden brown.</li>
						<li>8.Remove and place them on a wire rack to cool. They are best served warm with sweet or savory additions: cheese, ham, butter, and jam.</li>
